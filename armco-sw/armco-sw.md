## Plans
### Phase 1
The Foundations of the Mod's start.

This means the basic Ships, the basic parts, the basics of how it plays out.

This is, the basic Rebellion & Imperial ships used in the engagements as first played-out. This is the basic resource system, not needing any complicated full implementation, just their existence in.

Custom Components installed, for proper stat allowances.

### Phase 2
Advanced Parts, addition of the Larger opponents, Refinement of the systems in play.

This means, ensuring all encounter set-ups are working as wanted to the T, and seeing any space for improvements.

Getting the Custom-Fuel System, properly set-up, for use & refinement.

Additional Encounters set-up, for additions, if seen to.

Balancing Checks, of all stats on objects.

Heavier Capabilities, such as Cruiser implementation if not prior.

Consideration of the Progressive Tree's path.

### Phase 3
Refinement of the Core gameplay.

Checks & Balances.

Core Testing.

Investigation of additional features or capabilities that tie into the Core.

### Misc. Notes

#### 2018/06/04: Notes From Spacebar

phase 1: OT iconic ships: A-wing, X-wing, Y-wing all of which will use the parts i've been slaving over attached to blinky's ship. TIE Fighter/Interceptor/Bomber, Imperial prob droid which will be using Kreeg's premade parts which he's slaved over. Lucas is in charge of the encounter script, which he's been slaving over. All but the TIEs will use blinky's ships which i assume he's been slaving over as he has been MIA for some time now. I don't know if we're doing a vanilla and a modded version, that would probably be a lot more work that i don't know if Lucas wants to deal with. Will also include 2 large ships
Base line fighters Completed
Tie Fighter, Bomber, Interceptor
X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing.

1 Corvette Size Each.
Blockade Runner / Arquitens

1 Light Freighter
Yt-1300 /  imperial Gozanti

#### 2018/08/11: Turret Thoughts From CaptainShack

This is how I'm thinking turrets work for max fun.

Capital Weapons - 2X / 4x - Accurate. Slow firing Heavy hitter. Low traversal speed. Longest Range. 1000 / 800m
Medium Guns - Frigate / Cruiser Standard Weapons. Nice Salvo fire. Medium Damage. Tracks Corvettes easily. Medium Firing range. 600m Range.  Smallest ships probably Arquitens  because of its strange large gun setup for size.  Light Cannons - Rapid Fire. Before cooling down / reloading . Not very accurate. Visually stunning "filling the sky" weapon.

Small grid weapons. Deadly accurate. Low Damage.
